Great — let’s begin defining the **T81 ABI Specification**, which will govern how functions pass arguments, return values, align data, and use registers across compilation units targeting the `t81-unknown-none` platform.

Here’s the proposed **`T81_ABI.md`** document draft:

---

# 📘 T81\_ABI.md — Application Binary Interface for the T81 Architecture

## 📌 Purpose

This document defines the calling convention, register usage, stack alignment, and memory layout for binaries compiled to the **T81 ternary instruction set** (`.t81asm`) and executed on the **HanoiVM**.

It enables interoperability between compilers, libraries, and runtime systems using the `t81-unknown-none` LLVM target triple.

## 🔧 Calling Convention

### 🎯 Function Argument Passing

| Argument Index | Register      |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Arg 0          | `R1`          |
| Arg 1          | `R2`          |
| Arg 2          | `R3`          |
| Arg 3          | `R4`          |
| Arg 4          | `R5`          |
| Arg 5          | `R6`          |
| Arg 6          | `R7`          |
| Arg 7          | `R8`          |
| >8 arguments   | Ternary Stack |

* Registers `R1`–`R8` are used for the first 8 arguments.
* Remaining arguments are pushed right-to-left onto the ternary stack, aligned to 81-bit boundaries.

---

### 🔁 Return Value Convention

* The primary return value is placed in **`R0`**.
* Secondary return values (if any) spill to `R9`, `R10`, etc., or are returned via memory references passed in `R1`.

---

### 🧮 Stack and Frame Layout

* **Ternary Stack Alignment**: All frames aligned to **81 bits** (1 trit-word).
* **Frame Pointer**: `R80` is reserved as a logical frame pointer (`FP`).
* **Stack Pointer**: `R79` is used as a ternary stack pointer (`SP`).
* **Return Address**: Pushed to the stack prior to function body entry.

## 🧠 Register Usage Convention

| Register    | Usage                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `R0`        | Return value                          |
| `R1`–`R8`   | Arguments                             |
| `R9`–`R63`  | Temporary/Caller-saved                |
| `R64`–`R78` | Callee-saved (preserved across calls) |
| `R79`       | Stack Pointer (`SP`)                  |
| `R80`       | Frame Pointer (`FP`)                  |

---

## 🔁 Ternary Stack Growth

* The stack grows **"downward"** in ternary space: from high-index to low-index.
* Each frame contains:

  * Return address (1 trit-word)
  * Old `FP`
  * Saved callee registers
  * Local variables
  * Spilled arguments

## 🧬 Data Types & Alignment

| Type          | Size (bits) | Alignment (bits) |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `i27`         | 27          | 27               |
| `i81`         | 81          | 81               |
| `t243_bigint` | Variable    | 81               |
| `t729_tensor` | Variable    | 243              |

* All types are aligned to ternary-compatible sizes.
* Use `i81` as the standard scalar unit.

---

## 🧪 Varargs and Ellipsis (`...`)

* Variadic functions store additional arguments on the ternary stack after `R8`.
* A frame offset pointer (passed in `R2`) is used to access the start of the varargs list.

---

## 🔍 Exception Handling (Planned)

* A reserved opcode (`TRAISE`) will trigger unwind.
* Exception frames will track SP, FP, and RA.
* Support for ternary symbolic unwind handlers (`TUNWIND`) is under consideration.

---

## 💬 Remarks

* This ABI is designed to support symbolic, recursive, and AI-assisted computation.
* `T81` is register-rich to support functional-style recursion with minimal stack mutation.
* Integration with entropy tags (`!entropy`) and symbolic dispatch is optional but recommended.
