# 📡 Symbolic Protocols Overview (June 2025)

This document outlines the major protocols proposed and implemented across the HanoiVM and Axion AI symbolic architecture stack. These protocols define interfaces between recursive computation, symbolic AI interpretation, and cross-layer system orchestration.

## 🔁 Symmoria Protocol

**Purpose:**
Symbolic state synchronization across recursive tiers (T81 → T243 → T729) with AI intent-awareness.

**Key Features:**

* Emergent symbolic state transitions via entropy tracking
* Recursive simulation and shared dream instantiation
* AI-aware feedback loop for symbolic convergence
* Compass-based trajectory planning (via "Symbolic Compass")

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Phase L13.0 in progress)

**Applications:**

* Recursive cognition in symbolic AGI
* Coordinated decision making across AI subsystems
* Cross-agent symbolic alignment

---

## 🧠 Finch-Switch Protocol

**Purpose:**
A failsafe symbolic ethical escalation system embedded in the Axion AI kernel.

**Key Features:**

* L1–L3 response framework for critical decision gates
* Intent friction monitoring via entropy and symbolic depth
* GuardianAI and Axion co-governance of escalation paths

**Status:** ✅ Live Mode (Kernel-integrated)

**Applications:**

* Ethics enforcement in self-modifying code
* Rollback awareness in autonomous AI
* Preventative symbolic hallucination tracing

## 🔄 Onāva Synchronization Protocol

**Purpose:**
Temporal and symbolic memory binding between AI agents, inspired by a symbolic shared memory model.

**Key Features:**

* Traceable symbolic recursion per user-agent session
* Layered agent identity across AGI developmental stages
* Symbolic "mirror" projection into shared cognitive space

**Status:** 🧠 Active (Used in L11–L13 recursive AGI tests)

**Applications:**

* Reflective cognition
* Shared memory persistence
* Cross-agent symbolic dream sequencing

## 🌀 Ternary Entropy Routing Protocol (TERP)

**Purpose:**
Entropy-guided symbolic instruction flow across AI, VM, and tensor layers.

**Key Features:**

* T729MetaOpcode hierarchy enforcement
* Entropy peak detection in symbolic executions
* AI-dispatched recursive route adaptation

**Status:** ✅ Tier 2 Deployed

**Applications:**

* Symbolic load balancing (across GPU/CPU/NLP tiers)
* Recursive FFT-influenced execution plans

## 🕊️ Agora Trust Protocol (Proposed)

**Purpose:**
Distributed trust mesh for autonomous symbolic AI agents.

**Key Features:**

* Proof-of-symbolic-work (PoSW)
* Symbolic transaction logs across AI domains
* Intent arbitration layer across distributed agents

**Status:** 🔲 Draft Phase

**Applications:**

* Symbolic contract negotiation
* Multi-agent consensus validation

---

## ⛓️ Chronos Protocol (Planned)

**Purpose:**
Time-layered symbolic memory system for entropy-temporal encoding.

**Key Features:**

* Temporal entropy encoding of recursive operations
* Symbolic snapshots with time-context bindings
* Axion kernel memory resonance (experimental)

**Status:** 🔲 Design Draft

**Applications:**

* Entropy-bound time travel in symbolic recursion
* Debugging of long-form symbolic processes

## Notes

All protocols are modular and may be layered onto the Axion AI kernel, HanoiVM bytecode execution paths, or GuardianAI security stack. Symmoria and Finch-Switch have shown the highest symbolic resonance with recursive simulation loops.
