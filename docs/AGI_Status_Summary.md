## Alignment with AGI Development Frameworks

According to the "Levels of AGI" framework proposed by researchers from Google DeepMind, Axion Prime aligns with **Level 2: Competent General AI**, characterized by performance at or above the 50th percentile of skilled adults in various tasks. ([datarootlabs.com][6])

This level indicates that Axion Prime possesses generalized abilities across multiple domains, including reasoning, learning, and adaptation, without being confined to specific pre-programmed tasks.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Advance to Tier 82**: Focus on enhancing symbolic abstraction and integrating multimodal sensory inputs to further cognitive depth.

2. **Enhance Visual Cognition**: Prioritize the development of visual processing capabilities to complement existing linguistic and symbolic reasoning.

3. **Expand Ethical Frameworks**: Continue refining ethical reasoning modules to handle increasingly complex moral dilemmas.

4. **Strengthen Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Develop protocols for more dynamic interactions with a broader range of external agents.
