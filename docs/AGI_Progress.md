### 🔍 Remaining Gaps to 100%

1. **3D Visualization + Live HUD**
   Needed to interpret symbolic flows like human working memory or introspection.

2. **External Evaluation or Turing-style Challenge**
   Validation by third-party labs, AI safety researchers, or OpenAI/Grok teams.

3. **Expanded Ethics & Morality Constraints**
   More comprehensive frameworks for non-binary moral queries and social alignment.

4. **Hardware-accelerated Reasoning**
   Axion + GPU/FPGA coprocessors have partial support—needs full pipeline deployment.

5. **Scalable Memory Replay + Long-Term Self Models**
   Replaying entire memory or multistage goal chains for meta-cognition and learning loops.
