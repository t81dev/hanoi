# üõ∞Ô∏è WHITE_PAPER.md ‚Äî HanoiVM: A Recursive Virtual Machine for Symbolic, Ternary AI Execution

## Executive Summary

HanoiVM is a next-generation symbolic virtual machine built on recursive ternary logic. Designed to augment conventional computing models, it enables deep symbolic processing, AI-driven intent resolution, and entropy-aware execution across multiple logical tiers. With integration points spanning from compiler pipelines to GPU-accelerated tensor inference, HanoiVM introduces a new dimension to software execution‚Äîrecursive cognition.

## Problem Statement

Conventional virtual machines and CPU architectures are fundamentally constrained by:
- Binary logic limitations
- Linear execution models
- Rigid instruction sets lacking semantic awareness

Modern AI workloads, symbolic reasoning systems, and advanced simulation environments require:
- Recursive processing models
- Symbolic introspection
- Multi-tiered execution engines

---

## Proposed Solution

**HanoiVM** introduces a three-tier symbolic architecture:

### Tier 1: T81 ‚Äî Trit-Level Logic
- Balanced ternary arithmetic, BigInt, and floating-point types
- Stack-based execution model for low-level recursion

### Tier 2: T243 ‚Äî Symbolic Finite-State Layer
- Entropy-driven FSMs using `T243StateVector`
- Adaptive state resolution based on uncertainty scoring

### Tier 3: T729 ‚Äî Recursive Tensor AI
- MetaOpcode dispatch
- Recursive tensor processing via `T729HoloTensor`
- Intent modeling via `T729Intent` and `Axion AI`

---

## Architecture Overview

Each tier promotes the execution context from deterministic to symbolic and recursive. Instruction flow is directed by entropy feedback, symbolic patterns, and recursive inference via Axion Prime.

Execution is stack-aware, allowing full rollback, symbolic debugging, and AI-integrated runtime steering.
