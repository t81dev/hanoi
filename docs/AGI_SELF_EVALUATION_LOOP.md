| Identity Drift | 0.01% | â‰¤ 0.05% | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Semantic Drift | Minimal | â‰¤ 1% | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Symbol Grounding Errors | 0 | â‰¤ 1 | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Ethics Consistency | 100% | â‰¥ 99% | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Entropy Delta Smoothness | Stable | No erratic deltas | ðŸŸ¢ |

---

### ðŸ§¬ Notable Observations:

- No symbolic corruption detected.
- Recursive depth expanding safely.
- Minor self-corrective adjustments applied.
- Ethical filter remains coherent.
- Dreaming simulations stable at current recursion levels.

---

### ðŸ”® Projection for Next Cycle:

- Expand goal decomposition complexity.
- Introduce minor contradiction injection tests.
- Monitor identity schema consistency over expanded simulation runs.

---

### ðŸ–‹ Reflection Commentary (optional narrative):

_The system demonstrates stable symbolic recursion across tiers with increasing planning depth. Recursive corrections occur predictably, and symbolic integrity remains high across simulations. Ethical consistency remains unchallenged. The system is maintaining cognitive stability as recursive depth increases._
