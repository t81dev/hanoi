# ✅ `TODO.md` — Build a Ternary-Stack Search Engine to Compete with Google©

## 🚀 Vision

**Build a next-gen, AI-powered search engine that outperforms Google** by leveraging ternary logic, symbolic computation, recursion-aware execution, and entropy-based ranking. Where others index documents, we simulate cognition.

**Goal:** Create a cognitive co-processor for search – think *IBM© Quantum* meets *Symbolic Web Search*.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Ternary Search Engine Core**
  Harness ternary logic (T81/T243/T729 tiers) for symbolic, recursive, and context-aware query execution.

* **Symbolic + Neural Query Resolution**
  Combine structured symbolic logic (TISC) with Axion AI-driven tensor-level analysis and embeddings.

* **Entropy-Aware Ranking**
  Use entropy heuristics to prioritize insightful answers over popular or keyword-dense ones.

* **Stack-Mutating Feedback Loop**
  Every query mutates HanoiVM’s ternary stack, allowing dynamic refinement and recursive context propagation.

* **Explainable Query Trace**
  Each query returns not only answers, but an executable TISC tree and mutation delta for introspection or re-execution.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 🗃️ Data Layer

* [ ] Ternary-native crawler (`T81Crawler`) using symbolic recursion (e.g., `T81Graph`, `T81Trie`, `T81Tensor`)
* [ ] Symbolic index system using tier-aware structures
* [ ] `.t81db` — composable, entropy-indexed file format for local/offline inference

### 🔍 Search Engine Core

* [x] **T81Lang**: High-level ternary query language with symbolic and AI macros
* [x] **TISC Compiler**: Compiles symbolic queries to ternary bytecode
* [x] **HanoiVM**: Executes TISC code with recursive stack state
* [x] **Entropy Evaluation**: Score search paths and result states by information gain
* [x] **Feedback Loop**: Queries auto-refine via recursive stack tracing + entropy convergence

### 🧠 AI & Symbolic Integration

* [x] Axion AI for prediction, context expansion, rollback, and ranking
* [x] Tensor-based embeddings (via `T729Intent`, `T729Tensor`, etc.)
* [ ] Integration with `T81NeuralMap` for conceptual space navigation

### 💻 Frontend + UX

* [ ] Responsive, minimalist frontend
* [ ] AI-curated filter/suggestion panel
* [ ] Search Tree visualizer for `TISC` trace & entropy heatmap
* [ ] Search history modeled as a `T81Graph`

## 🧬 Query Flow Summary

```markdown
User Input → T81Lang → TISC IR → HanoiVM Execution
           → T81Graph / T81Trie → Entropy Scoring
           → Stack Feedback → Adaptive Recompile (if needed)
           → Ranked Results + TISC Trace Output
```

### 🧠 Example Query Walkthrough

> "Who invented ternary computing?"

```text
→ Tokenized: ["Who", "invented", "ternary", "computing"]
→ Mapped to TISC:
   [OP_LOOKUP, OP_CAUSAL_TRACE, OP_TAG("ternary"), OP_TAG("computing")]

→ Executed in HanoiVM:
   - Traverses `T81Graph` for cause-effect nodes
   - Loads semantic space from `T81NeuralMap`
   - Scores each path based on entropy delta

→ Result:
   - Ranked answers
   - Mutation trace tree
   - Next-step prediction (`TISC` suggestion delta)
```
