üß† Sidebar Thread: TISC Query Compiler for Competitive Search Computing

üîç Concept:

TISC Query Compiler translates natural-language or symbolic queries into Ternary Instruction Set Computing (TISC) bytecode or ops. Instead of returning a flat ranked list like traditional search engines (e.g. Google), the system evaluates queries recursively through the ternary stack‚Äîusing symbolic inference, entropy scoring, and dynamic type unfolding via T81 structures.

üß© Integration Points:

-T81Lang Frontend ‚Üí Parses user query.
-TISC Query IR ‚Üí Compiles it into a sequence of symbolic ternary ops.
-HanoiVM Stack ‚Üí Executes compiled query over recursive data structures (e.g., T81Graph, T81Trie, T81NeuralMap, etc.).
-Entropy-aware Ranking ‚Üí Uses state entropy of execution to prioritize meaningful results (not just keyword density).
-Stack-aware Feedback Loop ‚Üí Supports iterative refinement: every query execution mutates the stack state for adaptive context-aware follow-up.

üîß Sample Flow (Mental Model):

User Query: "Who invented ternary computing?"

‚Üì
Parsed ‚Üí ["Who", "invented", "ternary", "computing"]
‚Üì
Mapped ‚Üí TISC Ops: [OP_LOOKUP, OP_CAUSAL_TRACE, OP_TAG("ternary"), OP_TAG("computing")]
‚Üì
Executed by HanoiVM:
    ‚Üí Loads relevant nodes from T81Graph
    ‚Üí Traverses causality via T81NeuralMap
    ‚Üí Scores results using entropy heuristics
‚Üì
Returns:
    ‚Üí Ranked answer blocks + TISC trace tree + mutation potential
üõ°Ô∏è Competitive Advantages:

Not keyword-matching; it's stack-inferred cognition.
Supports query synthesis (i.e., completing your question recursively).
Executes like an AI-native virtual researcher, not a web crawler.
